## Contributing Translations

You can translate any article on the website into your language!

Add a Markdown file with the translation to the corresponding article folder. For example `index.fr.md` in `src/pages/optimized-for-change/`. If you're the first one to translate a post to your language, you'll need to add it to to the list in `src/utils/i18n.js`. See [this PR](https://github.com/gaearon/indesign.io/pull/159) for an example. **Please don't send translations for the Russian language â€” I will be translating into it myself when I find time.**
